# Learning-Website
A website that contains helpful code snippets.
This site was an interesting project which I created a couple of years ago and thought it would be nice if I uploaded it here. Back then I didn't know anything about backend so I only developed the frontend part of the site. Maybe I will update it in the future, though it would need some seriously big renovations in order to integrate backend properly.
